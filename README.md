# pacmark - a powerful declarative pacman wrapper

## Why This Project Exists

- **The Problem:** Desktop Linux systems accumulate unnecessary packages over time — apps installed briefly, forgotten, and left to clutter your system. This is a nightmare for small disks and system hygiene (run `pacman -Qq | wc -l` to see how many packages you have installed).

- **Why Current Solutions Fall Short:** Tools like NixOS are powerful but overly complex for users who don’t need complete reproducibility - just a clean clutter-free system.

- **My Solution:** A powerful declarative pacman wrapper that:
    - Lets you define a clean "reset state" for your system
    - Provides tools to manage and reset your system back to that declarative state
    - Forces you to explicitly define what you want to keep

## Usage

### Define Your System State

`pacmark` will generate a `packages.list` file in `~/.config/pacmark/packages.list` with the packages you currently have installed. Start by editing this file directly, or by running `pacmark edit`. The format is one package per line, with optional comments:

```bash
# Creative Software
gimp
audacity # This one is for Audio
blender

# Programming
bash
gcc
neovim # My favorite text editor
```

### Main Commands

- **`pacmark clean`**: Removes all stray packages (installed packages not marked in `packages.list`) and installs all missing packages (packages marked in `packages.list` but not installed).
- **`pacmark diff`**: Shows the difference between your current system and your `packages.list`
- **`pacmark list`**: Lists all packages in your `packages.list`
- **`pacmark mark <pkg1> <pkg2> ...`**: Marks packages and appends them to `packages.list`
- **`pacmark status <pkg1> <pkg2> ...`**: Shows the status of packages

## Manual Setup

1. **Download dependencies:**
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S bash pacman diffutils sed xargs make sudo
    ```

2. **Clone and install:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mantinhas/pacmark.git && cd pacmark && make install
    ```
